        <p id="center-blurb">You may heard of this game as Trump, T'rup Chaal, Raang, Court piece, Kot Pees, Troefcall.
            The objective of the game is to win 7 hands before the other team does.
            <br /> <br />
            First, we'll explain the rules as simply as possible. <br/>At the end, we offer some tips on strategy.

        <div id="call-trump" class="rightColumn">
            <h2>1. Call trump</h2>
            <p>First, you'll get to call trump based on the first five cards you are dealt.
               <b>Trump</b> is the card suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, or Spades) that will be
               more "powerful" than all the other suits.
               <br /> <br />
               You can pick any suit you want.
            </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div id="round-start" class="leftColumn">
            <h2>2. A round starts</h2>
            <p>On the first round, the trump-caller gets to play a card first. Play proceeds
               counter clock-wise until each player has played one card. After that, the
               player who won the round plays first on the next round.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div id="play-any-card" class="rightColumn">
            <h2>3. Play a card, any card (kinda)</h2>
            <p> If you're the first person to play in a round, you can play any card
                from any suit you want. After the first player has played, the suit of
                the card that is played is <b>on board</b>. Meaning, you have to play
                a card from that suit if you can.
                <br /><br />
                If you don't have cards in the suit that is on board, you can either
                <b>cut with trump</b> - play a card from the suit that is trump, or
                <b>walk-aside</b> - play a card from any other suit.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div id="card-beats-card" class="leftColumn">
            <h2>4. One card beats another </h2>
            <p> An Ace of Hearts beats a King of Hearts. A King of Hearts beats a
                Queen of Hearts. A Queen of Hearts beats a Jack of Hearts. And
                so forth.
                <br /><br />
                But if trump is Diamonds, the 2 of Diamonds beats all Hearts,
                Spades, or Clubs.
                <br /><br />
                When a card from the trump suit is compared to another card from
                that suit, the higher value wins.

            <h2>5. Teamwork</h2>
            <p> Your partner sits directly across from you (you may recognize
                Mat from the Hot Peppa Sauce comics).  At the end of a
                round, if you or Mat played the highest card, your team claims
                the hand. You need to win 7 hands before the other
                team does.
                <br /><br />
                Once a team wins 7 hands, the game is over.

<!-- tips -->
<section class="lt-yellow">
    <div class="row">
        <div id="tip-1" class="leftColumn">
        <h2>Tip 1: I'm in love, so I call Hearts as trump</h2>
        <p> Some people call trump based on seeing two or more of a certain suit
            in their hand. Others pick based on having a couple of <b>picture cards</b> -
            (Ace, King, Queen, Jack).
            <br /><br />
            Sometimes when women play with their significant others, they call
            Diamonds to drop a hint. You don't even have to have the card suit
            in your first five cards to call that suit trump.
            <br /><br />
            We don't recommend you pick based on the last two options, but
            we won't make fun of you if you do.
        </p>
       </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div id="tip-2" class="rightColumn">
            <h2>Tip 2: Playing first</h2>
            <p> When you're the first person to play a card in a round, you
                can play any card, even a card from the trump suit. Usually,
                players try to save trump cards for <b>cutting</b>. Sometimes,
                it's an effective strategy to try and force other players to
                play out their trump cards in the beginning of a game.
                <br /><br />
                We'll let you figure out when that's a good idea.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div id="tip-3" class="leftColumn">
            <h2>Tip 3: Cutting with trump</h2>
            <p> Let's say trump is Clubs, and Mat played the 3 of Diamonds. Then
                Bhaggie (the player to your left) plays a 4 of Diamonds. If you don't
                have any more Diamonds in your hand, you should consider playing a Club
                because it's a trump card, and beats the suit on board.
                <br /><br />
                Usually it's a good idea to play a low trump card when you cut, so that
                you don't waste your higher cards when you need to play a round that starts
                with trump.
                <br /><br />
                However, in this scenario if you play the 4 of Clubs, and Bushhead
                (the last player to play) plays the 5 of Clubs, because he was also
                out of Diamonds, he would win the hand.
                <br /><br />
                And if this happens, you'll be so disappointed.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div id="tip-4" class="rightColumn">
            <h2>Tip 4: Don't cut your partner</h2>
            <p> Consider this scenario. Bushhead (the kid to your right) plays a 4 of
                Hearts and Spades is trump. Then Mat (your partner) plays a King of
                Hearts. Then Bhaggie (the girl to your left) plays the 5 of Hearts.
                Next it's your turn to play.
                <br /><br />
                Your partner, Mat has the highest card on board, and is winning.
                <br /><br />
                If you have Hearts, you shouldn't play higher than him. If you don't
                have Hearts, you're better off walking aside, rather than cutting with
                trump.
                <br /><br />
                Sometimes, you won't have a choice, but when you do, try to
                let your partner win.
            </p>

    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div id="tip-5" class="leftColumn">
            <h2>Tip 5: Play a low card when you walk-aside</h2>
            <p> When there's a suit on board, and you don't have cards in that suit
                you can cut with trump, or walk-aside. When you walk-aside, it's
                best you chose a low card from another suit.
                <br /><br />
                No reason to get rid of high cards like Aces, Kings, and Queens
                when they can be used in the next round.
                <br /><br />
                Also, when you walk-aside you may want to consider playing the
                last card you have in a suit. That way, when that suit is played next
                you have the option to cut with trump.

            <h2>Final Notes</h2>
            <p> Normally, after a game is played, if the trump-caller was not on the team
                that won, the trump-caller moves counter-clockwise. For now, we're letting the user
                call all the time.
                <br /><br />
                We hope to make a number of advancements in game play, including better mobile
                support and multi-player capability.
